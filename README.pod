=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Test file:

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Test::More;
    use Test::FailWarnings;

    ok( 1, "first test" );
    ok( 1 + "lkadjaks", "add non-numeric" );

    done_testing;

Output:

    ok 1 - first test
    not ok 2 - Caught warning
    #   Failed test 'Caught warning'
    #   at t/bin/main-warn.pl line 7.
    # Warning was 'Argument "lkadjaks" isn't numeric in addition (+) at t/bin/main-warn.pl line 7.'
    ok 3 - add non-numeric
    1..3
    # Looks like you failed 1 test of 3.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module hooks C<$SIG{__WARN__}> and converts warnings to L<Test::More>'s
C<fail()> calls.  It is designed to be used with C<done_testing>, when you
don't need to know the test count in advance.

Just as with L<Test::NoWarnings>, this does not catch warnings if other things
localize C<$SIG{__WARN__}>, as this is designed to catch I<unhandled> warnings.
